    "text": "this is crap.. this cd is just bad. i've made myself listen to it all the way through about 6 times over trying to get myself into it, and i just can't. there's only like 2 good songs and the rest are bad. the beats sound like some ameteur producer made them; the rapping from cam'ron and guests sounds like people who're trying rap for the first time, and the lyrics are garbage. i mean, i absolutely love rap and hip-hop and have been a devoted listener since 1994, but this cd just didn't do it for me. maybe hardcore cam'ron fans would like this, but in my opinion, you could close your eyes at some cd store and pick a better rap cd than this."
